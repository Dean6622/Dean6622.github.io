            <dt class="retro_questions">WHAT WENT RIGHT IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</dt>
            <dd class="retro_answers">There were multiple things that went right with our development process. There was a clear improvement within our group in every area from iteration to iteration. The biggest improvement came from our communication. There was a big improvement in our communication as stated in our Iteration 2 retrospective, where our constant meetings improved our workflow. This continued over to Iteration 3, where we held consistent meetings on how to approach our development. Our biggest concern heading into the final iteration was the amount of bugs remaining in our project, due to time restrictions met in Iteration 2. Our planning ahead and thorough communication allowed us to identify such bugs and ensure that our final product was working properly.</dd>
            <dt class="retro_questions">WHAT WENT WRONG IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS</dt>
            <dd class="retro_answers">We were not able to implement as many features as we originally planned in iteration 0. This was caused by multiple issues. Our inexperience with Android Studio hampered our progress multiple times, causing issues with emulation and faulty system tests. We also underestimated the amount of time it would take to create tests for our project. Of course, we learned the importance of writing tests, but we had to make sure that such tests were written thoroughly and effectively, at the cost of development time. A significant amount of time was also spent on bugfixing and resolving technical debt. Overall, we believe that time management hampered our project the most. Towards the end, we learned to manage our time with consistent team meetings and proper use of the GitLab features.</dd>
            <dt class="retro_questions">WHAT DID WE LEARN ABOUT TEAM OR LARGE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT?</dt>
            <dd class="retro_answers">Participating in a large team project showed the importance of learning from mistakes and evolving our practices. Despite encountering various challenges such as underestimating time constraints and searching for bugfixes, each setback served as a catalyst for improvement. Through each iteration, we embraced a system of continuous learning and adaptation, honed our strategies and ultimately delivered a more refined product. This experience reaffirmed the value of open communication, collaboration, and adaptability in navigating complex projects. We learned that it is okay to make mistakes, since it allows us to improve ourselves for future projects. Moving forward, we learned to leverage these lessons to drive our projects towards success.</dd>
